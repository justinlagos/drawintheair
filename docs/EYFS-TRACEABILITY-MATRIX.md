# EYFS Traceability Matrix
## Draw in the Air - Educational Alignment

---

> **Important Note:** EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage) is not a checklist of games—it is a lens for intentional play, observation, and progress evidence. Each feature in Draw in the Air is designed with specific developmental outcomes in mind, enabling educators to observe, document, and support children's learning journeys.
