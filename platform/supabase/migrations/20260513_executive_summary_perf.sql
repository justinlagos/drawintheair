-- Insights — performance fix for dashboard_executive_summary
-- 2026-05-13
--
-- Symptom seen in production: HTTP 500 with Postgres code 57014
-- "canceling statement due to statement timeout" on /admin/insights when
-- the 7d window is selected.
--
-- Root cause: the previous version of the RPC built two CTEs (`curr`,
-- `prev`) that did `SELECT e.* FROM analytics_events e ...`. The `meta`
-- JSONB column is large and *not actually used* anywhere in this RPC's
-- aggregations. With ~6 weeks of accumulated events and growth
-- accelerating, the unbounded projection started exceeding the 8 s
-- statement timeout on Supabase's shared pool.
--
-- Fix: project only the 4 columns the function uses
-- (session_id, device_id, event_name, occurred_at). Also lift the
-- per-statement timeout to 30 s via a function-level SET, so this RPC
-- stays alive even if the role's default goes down later. JSON shape
-- consumers depend on is byte-identical to the previous version.
